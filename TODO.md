# TODO

This document is essentially a list of shorthand notes describing work yet to completed.
Unfortunately it is not complete enough for other people to pick work off the list and
complete as there is too much un-said.

* Figure out a way how to support J2CL based applications.

* Add mechanisms for merging multiple ruleSets into a single RuleSet.

* Apply ruleset to output using gwt-symbolmap

* Add a separate module containing a GWT Linker that emits the compile time properties for each permutation.
  This would be used to help determine what tests need to be run for each application.

* Simplify infrastructure so that it is trivial for each application to test it's own output
  applying rules from all included libraries.

* Add Grim metadata to the toolkits.
  - `arez-dom`
  - `arez-promise`
  - `arez-spytools`
  - `react4j`
  _ `spritz`
  - `galdr`
  - `replicant`

* Add Grim metadata to the sample applications.
  - `react4j-todomvc`
  _ `react4j-flux-challenge`
  - `react4j-drumloop`

* Add some basic documentation to README
