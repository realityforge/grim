# TODO

This document is essentially a list of shorthand notes describing work yet to completed.
Unfortunately it is not complete enough for other people to pick work off the list and
complete as there is too much un-said.

* Figure out a way how to support J2CL based applications.

* Apply ruleset to output using gwt-symbolmap

* Handling GWT specific mangling of member names such as `equals()` -> `$equals()`

* Change the handling of `OmitPattern` so that it can be only applied at package level and the pattern for type
  defaults to the package but can be anywhere. Also need to have a separate member pattern.
