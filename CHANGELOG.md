# Change Log

### Unreleased

* Fix bug where `@OmitSymbol` on methods that are devirtualized by the GWT compiler were not being matched. The devirtualization process creates a new method using the name of the old method prefixed with the `$` character. Update the annotation processor to follow this convention.
